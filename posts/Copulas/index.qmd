If all we have is the marginal distribution then we can no longer decompose the probability mass across the axis of the remaining random variable, without incoperating additional assumptions. The easiest of these Assumptions is to assume that X and Y are independent. If they are independent then we dont have to consider modelling their correlation because there is none. Remember that the opposite is not true 'Info Box!'. If X and Y are independent their joint distributions factorizes as the product of the two marginal distribution. 

Conditional distribution is not enough information to reconstruct the whole probability space (Betancourt Cond. Prob.)
